Notes on converting this from pjsouff's test suite:

* ZEBR8H: The 'area' card on the input file is commented out
          in Patrick's original template file for a faceting 
          tolerance of 1e-4.  For other tolerances the card
          exists.  I have left the card uncommented in this 
          test suite's input file.  The presence or absence
          of the card does not seem to affect the results at all.
