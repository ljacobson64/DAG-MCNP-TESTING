These files are used to run the benchmarking of DAGMC when it is a newly 
installed software and when a new version of DAGMC has been made.

This directory comes with the files wscript, benchmark_results.ods, and 
the cases directory. 

wscript - waf build description file.  The test suite can be run by first 
          invoking ./waf configure, then ./waf {options}.  Help for the options
          is available with ./waf --help.  ./waf summary will summarize results
          from a previously run test.

benchmark_results.ods - a spreadsheet with all of the results for the 
                        benchmarked cases compared to the results from native
                        MCNP.

The cases directory has the benchmark input and output files of the test cases.
In each case directory there are several files, described below; descriptions
of individual cases are below that.

FILES:
    README - the description of the problem and any extra notes on the way
                 the problem was tested
    
    DAGMC FILES (ones used to test DAGMC on your machine):
        ref.dag.inp - the MCNP portion of the input for the reference 
                      DAGMC run.
        ref.dag.mctal - the mctal file outputted from the reference 
                        DAGMC run.
        ref.dag.out - the output from the reference DAGMC run.
        ref.geom.h5m - the facet h5m file produced by a reference 
                       DAGMC run.
        ref.geom.sat - the geometry input file used by the reference
                       DAGMC run.
    
    MCNP FILES (supplied for reference and not tested on your machine):
        ref.native.inp - the MCNP input file that is just the MCNP 
                         version of the same geometry in ref.geom.sat.
        ref.native.out - the MCNP out from this geometry.  Used to show
                         how close DAGMC is the the answer MCNP gets.

CASES:
    01: Godiva sphere - This is an HEU sphere based on the Godiva benchmark.
                        Calculates keff.
    02: Beam on a plane - A beam is fired at the center of a plane.  A 
                          surface current tally is made on the other side.
    03: Beam along a surface - The beam is fired directly at the 
                               intersection of two cubes.  A surface current
                               tally is made on the other side.
    04: Beam along a curve/line - The beam is fired directly at the 
                                  intersection of four cubes, a line segment.
                                  A surface current tally is made on the 
                                  other side.
    05: Beam grazing a cylinder 1 - A beam is fired 0.001 cm within the edge
                                    of an H2O cylinder.  A flux tally on the
                                    cylinder is made.

    06: Beam grazing a cylinder 2 - Identical to 05 except the distance 
                                    tolerance is larger.

        NOTE: that the tallies for this case and case 05 are the same.

    07: Two fissile spheres in a vacuum 1 -  Calculates keff.
    08: Two fissile spheres in a vacuum 2 -  Calculates keff, uses implicit
                                             complement.  There currently is
                                             a statistically significant 
                                             difference in keff if run 
                                             sufficiently long.
    09: Thin spherical shell - Thermal neutron beam originating at the 
                               center of a void region (implicit complement)
                               upon a three layered H20 sphere with layers 
                               0.001 cm thick each.  Surface current tally 
                               on the reflected side.  Note that it 
                               currently has two lost particles and a high
                               run time.
    10: Beams on a plane - Five beams (axis in the z-direction) are fired at
                           the center of a disk with mu = 1, 0.98058, 
                           0.92848, 0.85749, 0.78087.  The surface current 
                           is tallied and each should have a score of 
                           around 1/5.
    11: Beams along a sphere - Same as 10 except instead of a plane, a 
                               sphere is used.  Note that tallies in 10 and
                               11 should be completely identical, and 
                               they are.
    12: Beam grazing a surface - A beam is fired grazing a surface at an 
                                 angle.  Tallies check to see if neutrons
                                 transport through correctly.
    13: Beam traveling down a small vent surrounded by iron - The vent is 
                                            the intersetion of two cylinders.

        NOTE: That the problem was run with two different nps values.  
              The 5E8 nps value was to reduce the statistical errors of
              the tallies and the 5E6 nps value is used to reduce run 
              time for testing purposes and is the default nps value.

 14: 3x3x3 Pu array of cylinders - 9 pillars with 3 cylinders each are on top 
                                   of a table and keff is calculated.  This
                                   can be compared to an experimental
                                   benchmark.

    15: 3 uranium cylinders - A solution of UO2F2 and water are in three aluminum
                              cylinders that are arranged in an equilateral
                              triangle. Keff is calculated.


UPDATING:
    If DAGMC is updated then the suite will have to be run again and the 
        ref.dag.out, ref.dag.mctal, and ref.geom.h5m file will have to be
    replaced for every case where the answers changed significantly as
        well as the result spreadsheet.

ADDING A CASE:
    This is done by creating a directory in the cases directory with a 8 
    files mentioned above.  The wiki page, result spreadsheet, wscript, 
    this README file should be updated appropiately as well.
