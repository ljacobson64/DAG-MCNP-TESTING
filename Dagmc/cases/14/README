The Pu array test problem is a 3x3x3 array of Pu cylinders. There are 9 
pillars each containing 3 Pu cylinders separated by spacers and heat sinks.
All of these are sitting on a slab on a table top. A better geometric 
decription can be found in the criticality handbook.

This problem was run with the cad and
compared with experimental results and MCNP5-1.51 results:

MCNP5-1.51:        1.00450, rel err = 0.00134
DAGMC:             1.00348, rel err = 0.00134
Experiment:        0.9953, rel err = 0.0010 (walls excluded)

*note that this problem does not have as good of agreement between the 
different solutions as godiva or the three U cylinders.
