 this tally meets the statistical criteria used to form confidence intervals: check the tally fluctuation chart to verify.
 the results in other bins associated with this tally may not meet these statistical criteria.

 normed average tally per history  = 4.67316E-03          unnormed average tally per history  = 7.34058E-02
 estimated tally relative error    = 0.0482               estimated variance of the variance  = 0.0134
 relative error from zero tallies  = 0.0000               relative error from nonzero scores  = 0.0482

 number of nonzero history tallies =       10000          efficiency for the nonzero tallies  = 1.0000

 (largest  tally)/(average tally)  = 1.13911E+02          (largest  tally)/(avg nonzero tally)= 1.13911E+02

 (confidence interval shift)/mean  = 0.0025               shifted confidence interval center  = 4.68492E-03


 if the largest  history score sampled so far were to occur on the next history, the tfc bin quantities would change as follows:

      estimated quantities           value at nps           value at nps+1           value(nps+1)/value(nps)-1.

 the estimated slope of the 200 largest  tallies starting at  6.38695E-01 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the history score probability density function appears to have an unsampled region at the largest  history scores:
 please examine. see print table 161.

 fom = (histories/minute)*(f(x) signal-to-noise ratio)**2 = (9.374E+06)*( 2.074E-01)**2 = (9.374E+06)*(4.303E-02) = 4.034E+05

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

    14   passed the 10 statistical checks for the tally fluctuation chart bin result               
         passed all bin error check:     2 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.
